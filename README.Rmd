Parcel ID (Character): String containing a set of numbers to describe a unique ID for each parcel. The string can be a 10 digit ID value beginning with a 0.

Address (Character): String containing the address to which the parcel is addressed to. All address strings are in the form of "Number Street, Ames". They do not have a definite data range as they're strings, but they'll all be within Ames.

Style (Factor): This is a factor variable with 12 levels of strings which describes a different style layout of the house. It's range is between the 12 possible levels.

Occupancy (Factor): This is a factor variable with 4 different levels of strings which describes the amount of people that can live in a home. The ranges are between Condominium Single-Family / Owner Occupied, Townhouse, Two-Family Conversion Two-Family Duplex

2. Our main variable of special interest in this dataset is the sale price of the homes

3. 
'''{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=ames, aes(x=`Sale Price`)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=8000)

median(ames$`Sale Price`)
'''
Since our main variable is numeric, we chose a histogram. Taking a dive into the chart, we can see that the median price of a home is at $170,900. FINISH

Manas:
'''{r}
library(dplyr)
new_data <- filter(ames, `YearBuilt` > 1500, `Sale Price` > 0, !is.na(`YearBuilt`), !is.na(`Sale Price`))
ggplot(data=new_data, aes(x=`YearBuilt`, y=`Sale Price`)) + geom_point()
